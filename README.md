# Radiata_B
A simple chatbot specialized for an anime, Lycoris Recoil (NOT DONE YET)

# Current condition
still working on main Python file, basic structure of chatbot is already constructed, I am just putting data to be trained. The file is not uploaded yet.

# Requirements
Python 3.7 

Windows 10 or above

(To run the main python code, you will need Python 3.7.

Please download it via https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/ )

# How to run
just run 'launch.bat' to start by double-clicking it.

Then the library chatterbot 1.0.4 will be automatically installed if you have Python 3.7 installed.

It will open cmd, then wait for a while, it should take less than 20 seconds, et voilà!

The screen below should appear.

You can start typing to search things about the masterpiece anime, Lycoris Recoil.

# Just to let you know
As this is not for communicating but for searching information about specific anime, json nor yaml files are not used for the training data. That is why it takes a little bit longer to load the trainers.

# 日本語について
日本語も含める予定ですが、データが大きくなるので、答えられる質問は少なくなります。

英語である質問は全て翻訳を頑張ってみます。

後日日本語版を出そうか迷っているところです。
